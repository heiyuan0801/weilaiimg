I've been creating dashboard UIs at work and for my personal projects. I always wanted to make a reusable collection of dashboard UI for future projects; and here it is now. While I've created a few custom components, some of the code is directly adapted from ShadcnUI examples.

> This is not a starter project (template) though. I'll probably make one in the future.

## Features

- Light/dark mode
- Responsive
- Accessible
- With built-in Sidebar component
- Global search command
- 10+ pages
- Extra custom components
- RTL support

<details>
<summary>Customized Components (click to expand)</summary>

This project uses Shadcn UI components, but some have been slightly modified for better RTL (Right-to-Left) support and other improvements. These customized components differ from the original Shadcn UI versions.

If you want to update components using the Shadcn CLI (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`), it's generally safe for non-customized components. For the listed customized ones, you may need to manually merge changes to preserve the project's modifications and avoid overwriting RTL support or other updates.

> If you don't require RTL support, you can safely update the 'RTL Updated Components' via the Shadcn CLI, as these changes are primarily for RTL compatibility. The 'Modified Components' may have other customizations to consider.

### Modified Components

- scroll-area
- sonner
- separator

### RTL Updated Components

- alert-dialog
- calendar
- command
- dialog
- dropdown-menu
- select
- table
- sheet
- sidebar
- switch

**Notes:**

- **Modified Components**: These have general updates, potentially including RTL adjustments.
- **RTL Updated Components**: These have specific changes for RTL language support (e.g., layout, positioning).
- For implementation details, check the source files in `src/components/ui/`.
- All other Shadcn UI components in the project are standard and can be safely updated via the CLI.

## ImageHub full-stack mode

This repository now contains the initial ImageHub implementation. The React/Shadcn admin is served by the Go API in the production image. See [`backend/README.md`](backend/README.md) and [`outputs/IMAGE_HOSTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md`](../../outputs/IMAGE_HOSTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md) for the current architecture, Docker deployment and remaining milestones.

### ImageHub implementation status

ImageHub includes a real Go API, PostgreSQL migrations, Redis sessions, local login/registration/recovery pages, local/Telegram storage adapters, SVG/GIF/video and remote import endpoints, a PostgreSQL media worker, system settings, image library search/filter/bulk actions, team/member invitations, Stripe checkout/webhook reconciliation, verified custom domains with Caddy on-demand TLS, Cloudflare purge hooks, OIDC PKCE/JWKS validation, Docker Compose, and backup/restore scripts. Deployment and operational requirements are in [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md); the detailed scope is tracked in [the implementation plan](../../outputs/IMAGE_HOSTING_SYSTEM_PLAN.md).
